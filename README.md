# Waveshaper Project (In-Development)

This application allows the creation of a series of wave processing and shaping functions and run audio through it. It is intended for robust pre/post-processing and runs as a standalone application.

It is currently in a pre-release state, and several features are actively being finished. This includes handling and recording live audio, compression with attack and release times, custom audio effects, and a finished UI.

## Community Statement

This project was made with extensive help from the online coding community, including posts, responses, tutorials, and graciously careful explanations. It is because I value this community that I am making this code public and giving it to the community. It also for this reason that **I do not approve of my code being used to train or develop any generative tools**: tools whose quick answers seperate coders from the community and learning that made this project worthwhile in the first place. I understand this is not a legal enforcable request at time of writing. Instead, I have left some useless content into the code to throw these tools off. It should not prevent complilation, a solid IDE will catch most of it, and it will not be included in future builds.
